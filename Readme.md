I've pulled data from static bahis and had some fun formatting it (all the different forms submissions are in one table with the actual data stored as key:value pairs). I have uploaded the data for you into google drive, those are files in a format `formdata_*.csv`.
You will notice however that it is not possible to find out what different indexes mean in many cases. I leave that for you to find out as you go through whichever dataset you find most interesting. The tables that contain keys for submitted data are in `input/STATICBAHIS*.csv` files, though at this point I'm not sure what is what.
